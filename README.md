Examples of design patterns in Ruby

# Adapter 
helps two incompatible interfaces to work together

# Decorator 
vary the responsibilities of an object adding some features

# Iterator
provides a way to access a collection of sub-objects without exposing the underlaying representation

# Singleton used on Null Object
singleton: have a single instance of certain class across the application
Null object: avoiding type-checking in favor of duck typing.

# View Object
allows you to build complex page logic using simple view logic wrappers.
